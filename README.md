- Hi, I’m an aspiring programmer looking to further advance my knowledge and skills in computer science. I’m interested in back-end development, specifically with Java and its object-oriented properties that make it extremely accessible and robust as a programming language. I also have experience with C/C++, HTML/CSS, and Python.
